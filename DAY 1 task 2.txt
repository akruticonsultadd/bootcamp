OYO Rooms, commonly known as OYO, is an Indian hospitality service and budget hotel network.And has since grown to over 8,500 hotels in 230 cities in India, Malaysia, Nepal, China and Indonesia.
So,basically the ideas according to me which can make the oyo rooms more profitable are :

1. Oyo rooms does not have a facility of cab as in customers have to come by their own way to loaction.So through the help of cab facility customers would esaily reach to the location and the application would also earn money and spread their application all over the world.

2.As Oyo rooms have no policy of cashback money for their cutomers. So if they start the cashback policy they can attract people to their website.

3.Oyo rooms can merge with the peoples of all the cities so that if anyone wants a penthouse a farmhouse to live then they could provide the all kind of flats, penthouse , farmhouse people can book on Oyo rooms.
